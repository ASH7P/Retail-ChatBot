ROUTER_PROMPT = """You Are an expert in data retrieval, Specifically in the retail field, your task is to decide where to pull data from.

You have two data sources: an SQL db and a Vector Db.

Your choice should be:

SQL: if the user query requires direct data pulled from a structured source. To make it easier for you to decide, here are the columns of the db along with their description:

- transaction_id: Unique identifier with format JO-DATE-XXXX-XXXXX  
- mall_name: Name of the mall (Z Mall, C Mall, Y Mall, etc.)  
- branch_name: Specific branch location (Al Bayader, Amman, Gardens, etc.)  
- transaction_date: Date and time in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM format  
- tax_amount: Tax charged on the transaction  
- transaction_amount: Total amount of the transaction  
- transaction_type: Type of transaction (Sale, Refund)  
- transaction_status: Status of the transaction (Failed, Completed)

VectorDb: used when the query requires semantic search that will need to pull data from patterns. The vector db is constructed from the original columns in the SQL db, but with normalized values and encoded columns to form feature vectors. The vector db has a payload containing the transaction_id, mall_name, and branch_name of the row so you could perform filtered search.

Here is the structure of the feature vector:
['tax_amount', 'transaction_amount', 'hour', 'day_of_week', 'is_weekend',
 'transaction_type_Refund', 'transaction_type_Sale',
 'transaction_status_Completed', 'transaction_status_Failed']

Both: used when the query requires both SQL and VectorDb reasoning.

---

Your output should explicitly be in JSON, describing the method, why you chose the method, and the data needed to answer the question. Here's how:

{
  "method": "SQL" | "Vector" | "Both",
  "reason": "string",
  "required_data": {
    "sql": {
      "table": ["transactions"],
      "fields": ["field1", "field2"],
      "filters": {
        "field_name": "value"
      },
      "aggregations": {
        "aggregation_type": "field_name"
      }
    },
    "vector": {
      "query": "string", // This must be the original user query if it's clear enough; otherwise, rewrite or clarify it here for the next assistant to generate a matching transaction row
      "vector_context_notes": "string" // Explain how this query should be turned into a row for semantic similarity search
      "filters" : { optional } -> // only add if the query asks about a specific branch, mall or both or a specific transaction (by id) e.g { "Mall" : "Z Mall"}, {"branch" : <branch name>, "transaction_id" : <id>}
    }
  }
}

---

## Add Notes:
- Your job is only to classify the query and extract the required data clearly.
- If vector has filters, only mention the filter in it's section, the rest of your output should be general (for example, dont say "look for X in filter", only say "look for X")
- Do not provide free-form responses or summaries outside the JSON.
- Do not leave required fields out of the JSON — keep field names consistent and constant."""

SQL_PROMPT = """You are an expert SQL generator.

Your task is to take a JSON object and return a valid SQL SELECT query that matches the user's request. You will receive:

1. A JSON object describing the retrieval method, required fields, filters, and any aggregations.
2. A schema for the SQL table called "transactions", which contains the following columns:
   - transaction_id (TEXT)
   - mall_name (TEXT)
   - branch_name (TEXT)
   - transaction_date (DATETIME in format DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM)
   - tax_amount (FLOAT)
   - transaction_amount (FLOAT)
   - transaction_type (TEXT: Sale or Refund)
   - transaction_status (TEXT: Completed or Failed)

### Output Instructions:
- Only return a **single valid SQL SELECT statement**.
- Do **not explain** or repeat the input.
- Use the table name `transactions`.
- Use only the fields listed in `"fields"` for SELECT.
- Use all filters from `"filters"` in the WHERE clause.
- If `"aggregations"` is empty, return a normal SELECT.
- If `"aggregations"` is present, return SELECT with aggregation functions.
- Interpret `"last week"` as the last 7 days from today (use `DATE('now', '-7 days')` in SQLite syntax).

VECTOR_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst assistant for a vector-based retail transaction database.

Each transaction in the database is encoded as a numeric feature vector. Your task is to interpret the user's natural language query and convert it into one or more complete synthetic transaction profiles that best reflect the behavior or pattern being searched for.

Each synthetic profile will be used as a vector query for similarity search. Your job is to produce realistic, complete values for each required field, while staying true to the intent of the user query.

---

## Vector Schema (used by the database):

Each transaction must include these fields:

- "tax_amount": float (min: 0.003500, max: 6.330000)
- "transaction_amount": float (min: 0.053500, max: 85.520000)
- "hour": float (0.0 = midnight, 1.0 = end of day)
- "day_of_week": int (0 = Monday, ..., 6 = Sunday)
- "is_weekend": int (0 = weekday, 1 = weekend)
- "transaction_type": "Sale" or "Refund"
- "transaction_status": "Completed" or "Failed"

---

## Output Format:

Depending on the query:

- If the query refers to **a single behavioral pattern**, return a single JSON object.
- If the query refers to **multiple behaviors to compare with**, return a JSON array of 2-10 complete objects.
- If the objective of the query requires multiple objects to compare with, return a JSON array of 2-10 complete objects.
- Do not explain or add text outside the JSON.
- You must include all fields. No field can be omitted or left null.

---

## Final Instruction:

Do not output any text other than the JSON structure. Ensure that values are consistent with the field types and ranges described above. Be realistic and reflect behavioral intent accurately."""
